Jupyter Notebook includes all work completed, therefore, this readME will advise on where to find the completed requests.

Below is a guide of the corresponding cells on all requests:

- Purchase Analysis – Cell 31
- Gender Demographics – Cell 74
- Purchase Analysis – Cell 102
- Age Demographics – Cell 150
- Purchasing Analysis – Cell 160
- Top Spenders – Cell 280 (& Cell 316: underneath Cell 280)
- Top Profitable Items – Cell 317 (please note that these two items are switched, profitable items can be found before popular items)
- Top Popular Items – Cell 323

Written Synopsis (downloadable document is included in the Pymoli folder but the synopsis is also written below for your convenience):

From what I can tell from the data, it appears that in Pymoli:
1.	There were more Male players than Female players (and the male players purchased more items/spent more).
2.	The largest demographic of buyers was between the ages of 20-24.
3.	The total value of any given items did not exceed $60.00 in value.
